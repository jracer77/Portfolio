## Portfolio Fall 2017 KSU

### Please see the provided Table below for a list of my GitHub portfolio projects. This Portfolio will remain consistant of HTML, CSS and SQL programming languages to follow my KState cirriculumn for the Fall 2017 semester. I'm constantly learning new programming languages on my own such as HTML, CSS, SQL, DreamWeaver and Java SE (JDK) w/NetBeans. As I create outside projects, I will place them in the perspective corresponding language folder's. 

Thank you,
